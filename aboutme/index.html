    <p><b>Hello Everyone! I'm Sam and i became a member of the Church in 2018. I am 28 years old, married and blessed with a 5-week old lovely daughter. I am Nigerian, i live in Lagos, Nigeria and it is a common saying that we are the happiest People on the african continent! :)  Late last year, i developed huge interest in how the web and internet works. I currently work as a customer service agent and would love a career switch into the tech world. </b></p>
    <p><b>I love spending time with my little family, when im not with them or at work then i most likely seeing a soccer game or playing soccer on the pitch. My favorite soccer team is FC Barcelona, domiciled in spain. Lionel Messi is my favorite player :)) </b></p>
    <p><b>Having read a few things about my Colleagues in this course, the thirst for knowledge and drive to learn new things regardless of our ages, different backgrounds and cultures as well as different career paths really really fascinates me. BYU-Idaho is indeed a great blessing in our lives. I would love to be a fullstack developer in a few years, there is no better place to gain this knowledge other than BYU-Idaho!</b></p>
    <p><b>My favorite quote is "God judges men according to the use they make of the light which he gives them", which is a counsel given by the Prophet Joseph Smith in Nauvoo. It is a counsel that keeps me in check and reminds me to make righteous use of every skill and knowledge i gain while here on earth and to also strive to gain as much knowledge as i can on my earthly journey.</b></p>
